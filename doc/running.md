Running NNTPChan
================

Once you have [built NNTPChan](building.md) and done [the initial setup you](setting-up.md) you can start NNTPChan.

You can now start the NNTPChan node (srndv2) by running:

    ./srndv2 run

Now you can check out the web-interface by navigating to 127.0.0.1:18000 (default address - unless you have changed it in your `srnd.ini`) or you can [configure your newsreader](extras/configure-newsreader.md).
