    <dt>What is nntpchan?</dt>    
    <dd>NNTPCchan is a federated imageboard that spans across several networks including tor, i2p and anonet. There are no central servers so that as long as 1 server is left the forum will continue to function.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt>How is this different from *chan?</dt>
    <dd>NNTPChan is by design invulnerable to global censorship. All moderation is local to each server.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt>How does moderation work then?</dt>
    <dd>Moderation is done with our special tripcodes (ed25519-sha512 signed posts). Anyone can give moderation suggestions, but that doesn't mean anyone will accept them. Those who trust the actions of a moderator can have their frontend whitelist the moderation actions and have them performed without oversight by another moderator.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt>How can I remove content from nntpchan completely?</dt>
    <dd>‾\(._.)/‾ I don't know. You probably can't unless every server agrees to remove the content, even then, nothing prevents someone from reposting it. You can't delete what you post on the internet.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt>do you allow child porn?</dt>
    <dd>no.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt>Do you allow XYZ content?</dt>
    <dd>If it violates USA Law or causes problems with my host, no. Otherwise, probably.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt>Someone posted something I don't like but it's not illegal</dt>
    <dd>That is not my problem. All posts on this site are the responsibility of the individual poster and not the administration of this server</dd>
